- The C++ code itself is technically beautiful. Since it reverse words in a sentence in-place. For example given an input of “I do not deserve”. It will output “deserve not do I”. (Sample usage can be referred to the attached .cpp file). This algorithm has a O(n) time complexity (very fast) and O(1) memory complexity (do not locate any additional variable relative to string size n). It is possibly the fastest algorithm to complete this reverse job.

- The reason I implement this reverse algorithm for this poet is to hint the reader: If we can reverse everything we did, we said or even we succeed in,  we may live a better life. However, it is impossible for us to manipulate the time. The biggest wish of our character in this poet, it to reverse the time. Unfortunately, he couldn’t. He has to commit his life to suffer the consequence.  

- This poet describes the feeling of an upset man right before he subside. Basically saying he can not get rid of his past. And do not have courage to face his future. In the last sentence, my past, now is my whole life hints our character choose to end his life eventually.

- I blend every C++ keywords into the poetry. Which means I do not ignore any of the word in my code. So there may be some part a little bit weird. For example, what I mean by meat is body. I am not a native speaker. But to me it is fine because I already hint the reader, while meat is my body So I think maybe we can consider it as a poetic expression. After all, I know this. Most of them is due to my trying to make it perfect and do not ignore a single word.
